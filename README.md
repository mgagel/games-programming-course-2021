# Games Programming - Alita's Journey

This group project was created for the Course "Games Programming" in 2021 at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences. The repository contains the code for a prototype 2D top-down shooter. Most of our assets were created by the artists in our project group. In the game, the user plays in a sci-fi setting as war veteran Alice "Alita" Takeda. She travels with an alien baby named Vøk who has a high bounty on his head, which in turn attracts many bounty hunters. The player has to find clues about Vøks home and then bring him there safely. A unique selling point of the game is the double-character mechanic. The player can only control Alita, but has to watch out for both Alitas and Vøks health points. Vøk can be picked up and taken off by the player. Picking up Vøk significantly slows the player down, though, which makes it harder to avoid the patrolling enemies.

## How to use

The "Game" directory contains a Unity project that can be imported. By starting the runtime engine inside Unity, a main menu opens up. From there, the player can click the steering wheel to start the game or open other submenus.

## Technologies

* C#
* Unity 2021.1.7f1
